Extremely rudimentary Android app of an alarm clock that demands the user to complete games/puzzles/math problems
to snooze the alarm rather than the use of a simple click of a button. Features that must be worked on:
  - EXTREME CHANGES TO UI DESIGN (Lacks CSS support)
  - Ability to set multiple alarms
  - Alarm doesn't even go off if you exit the app lol.. 
  - Many other things once they come to mind...
